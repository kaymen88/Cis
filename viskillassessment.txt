I said a hip hop, hippie to the hippie 
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
The hip, hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
To the bang bang boogie, say, up jump the boogie
A host, of golden daffodils;
To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
